	"Nacre" is the material that sea shells are made of. Anyone who has played with sea shells
	as a child knows that they are incredibly tough and strong. Why is this interesting? 
	Afterall, nacre is not the toughest or the strongest material known to man (steel is way tougher,
	diamond is way stronger). 
	While the absolute toughness of nacre is not interesting in itself, it is rather 
	interesting when compared to the toughness of the materials that nacre is made up of. 
	So, what 
	exactly is nacre made up of? As it turns out, over 95% of nacre is black board
	chalk (aragonite). Now, chalk is neither hard nor tough. What of the remaining 5% or so?
	The remaining 5% is a sort of organic glue that holds the pieces of chalk together. 
	And thats the mystery: How does nature take two rather ordinary ingredients, namely 
	chalk and some glue, and make something incredibly strong and tough like sea shells?
	This mystery, or some version of it, exists in all the nature's structural materials,
	including wood, tooth, bones, turtle shells, antlers, and so on.

	<p>
	The high magnification SEM (Scanning Electorn Microscope) shown above (Fig. 1) 
	sheds some light on the actitecture of nacre. As the figure shows, nacre is
	made out of thin bricks of aragonite arranged in a manner similar to the 
	bricks in a wall. This is the so-called brick and mortar structure. The role
	of the mortar is played by the organic glue. Figure 2 shows an idealized
	2D cross-section of this structure. Note that this figure is not accurate 
	in scale. In reality the mortar (organic glue) layer is much thinner, 
	and the bricks have a much higher aspect ratio. As one can imagine, this 
	structure can make crack propagation tougher because the strain can get 
	localized in the ductile mortar phase, and because cracks can get deflected
	at any of the  multiple interfaces.

	A very simple analysis can be used to obtain the elastic moduli
	of materials with a brick and mortar structure. In this analysis 
	we make a number of simplifying assumptions. We assume that the 
	thickness of the mortar is small compared to the thickness of the 
	bricks, which in turn is small compared to the width of the bricks, i.e,

	$$ t_1, t_2 \ll h \ll w.$$

	The validity of these assumptions is evident from the observed geometry 
	of nacre. Further, we assume that the bricks can be treated as 
	rigid, i.e., all the strain is localized in the mortar phase. 
	This assumption is also well justified since the bricks 
	are much stronger than the mortar phase. We will consider the
	implications and limitations of this assumption in detail later.
	For the purpose of this analysis we assume that the unit cell 
	has a vertical axis of symmetry, i.e., \(e = 0\) in figure 3. The 
	resulting unit cell is shown in figure 4.

	</figure>
	<figure >

	<p>
	The unit cell shown in figure 4 has a horizontal axis of symmetry as well. This is somewhat difficult to 
	see in figure 4. However, if we draw the same unit cell in a different manner, then it becomes apparent (figure 5).
	Why do we bother? It turns out that symmetry is very important in theory of elasticity. While a general 
	linear elastic material in 3D is characterized by 21 constants, a fully isotropic material (material with infinite symmetry) 
	is characterized by just 2 constants! This is a huge reduction in complexity. For our analysis we only consider 
	a 2D structure of nacre. A general elastic 2D material is characterized by 6 elastic constants. How many constants can we 
	do away with based on the symmetry of the unit cell shown in figure 5?
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
	Let us first see why a general 2D material is characterized by 6 elastic contants. There are several ways of 
	thinking about this. I prefer to think as follows. The elastic constants give mapping between the 
	stress and the strain. The matrix representing this linear map must be symmetric since it is obtained 
	as a second gradient of the energy density function. The most general such mapping can be written as
	$$	
		\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11} \\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix}	= 
		\begin{bmatrix} c_{11} & c_{12} & c_{13} \\ c_{12} & c_{22} & c_{23} \\ c_{13} & c_{23} & c_{33} \end{bmatrix}	
		\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_{11} \\ \epsilon_{22} \\ 2\epsilon_{12} \end{bmatrix},	
	$$
	involving a total of 6 independent elastic constants. Now, due to the vertical symmetry axis, a strain 
	in the 11-direction cannot lead to a stress response in the 12-direction. This gives \(c_{13} = 0\). Similarly,
	due to the horizontal symmetry axis we get \(c_{23} = 0\). We further assume that the mortar material has 
	zero poison's ratio. This combined with the assumption of rigid bricks leads to \(c_{12} = 0\). This massacre 
	of elastic constants leaves us with 3 unknown constants, and the stress-strain relation reads
	$$	
		\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11} \\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix}	= 
		\begin{bmatrix} c_{11} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & c_{22} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & c_{33} \end{bmatrix}	
		\begin{bmatrix}\epsilon_{11} \\ \epsilon_{22} \\ 2\epsilon_{12} \end{bmatrix}.	
	$$
	Of all our assumptions, the one leading to \( c_{12} = 0 \) is perhaps the weakest, while the vertical symmetry 
	axis is the second weakest. We stick with these for the time being in favor of simplicity. Our next task is 
	to find the 3 remaining elastic constants. For this purpose we further assume \( t_1 = t_2 = t \).
	</p>

	<p>
	The analysis here is rather simple and covers only the elastic regime, however, the assumption of rigid bricks simplifies the 
	problem a lot, and there is hope that under this assumption one can solve the more general elastic problem. 
	Let us first apply a uniaxial strain \(\epsilon_{11}\). The net deformation of the unit cell in the 1-direction 
	is then \(\delta = (w + t)\epsilon_{11}\). Then, the elastic energy of the unit cell (per unit depth)
	can be written as 
	\begin{equation}
	\psi(\delta) = 2 h t \left( \frac{1}{2} E \left(\frac{\delta}{t}\right)^2 \right) + 4 \frac{w}{2}t \left(\frac{1}{2}G\left(\frac{\delta}{2t}\right)^2 \right),
	\end{equation}
	where \(E, G\) are the Young's modulus and the shear modulus of the mortar, respectively. The effective 
	modulus of the unit cell in the 1 direction is \( c_{11}\), thus the corresponding effective energy would be 
	\begin{equation}
	\psi(\delta) = 2(h+t)(w+t)  \left(\frac{1}{2}c_{11}\left(\frac{\delta}{w+t}\right)^2 \right).
	\end{equation}
	Equating the above two expressions, we get
	\begin{equation}
	c_{11} = E \frac{h}{t}\frac{w+t}{h+t} \left( 1 + \frac{wG}{4hE}\right) \approx E \frac{w}{t}\left( 1 + \frac{wG}{4hE}\right) \approx G\frac{w^2}{4ht}.
	\end{equation}
	Similarly, if we apply a uniaxial strain \( \epsilon_{22} \), then the deformation in the 
	2-direction is \( \delta = 2(h+t)\epsilon_{22} \), and the net elastic energy of the unit cell (per unit depth)
	is approximately
	\begin{equation}
	\psi(\delta) = 4\frac{wt}{2}\left( \frac{1}{2}E\left(\frac{\delta}{2t}\right)^2\right),
	\end{equation}
	while the effective energy for the cell is (approximately)
	\begin{equation}
	\psi(\delta) = 2hw \left( \frac{1}{2}c_{22}\left(\frac{\delta}{2h}\right)^2\right).
	\end{equation}
	Equating the above two expressions we get 
	\begin{equation}
	c_{22} \approx  E \frac{h}{t}.
	\end{equation}
	Finally, by using similar arguments for a simple \( \epsilon_{12} \) deformation, we get 
	\begin{equation}
	c_{12} \approx G\frac{h}{2t}
	\end{equation}
	</p>
	<p>
	How good are the assumptions that we made in the above derivations? The geometrical assumptions \( t \ll h \ll w\) are 
	fairy well justified. What about the assumption of rigid bricks? That assumption is well justified so long as 
	the strain is mostly localized in the mortar. Another way of thinking about this is that if nacre is much less 
	stiffer than aragonite then our approximations are good. It turns out that while nacre is less stiffer 
	than aragonite, its not much less stiffer. Thus our approximations are questionable. The model 
	can thus be improved upon by including more realistic deformation. In fact, 
	Begley et. al. have done such an analysis for a uniaxial deformation. This also shows that nature does not work 
	to make our analysis simpler!
