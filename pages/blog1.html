	<h2> An Open Letter.</h2>

	Subject: Mr. Kejriwal is in jail. It suits him well. <br><br>

	<p>
	Dear Mr. Kejriwal, 
	You seem to be confused about this whole jail situation. Let me clarify it for you. 
	People will tell you that you are in jail because you violated such and such a law or defamed a politician. 
	Bullshit. These things happen all the time. You see, you and these people pay too much attention to the 
	letter of the law, all the while ignoring its spirit, its interpretation, its practiced and implemented form, if you will. You must be an engineer.
	</p>

	<p>
	While you sit in jail, as you will be for a long time, please take my advice seriously and look around. 
	Do you see any other politician there? You might want to find out if Lalu, who robbed the poorest of 
	India for hundreds of crores of rupees, and was convicted by a CBI court and the honorable supreme 
	court of India (I just love saying the honorable supreme court, as if that makes the court better!) 
	for his crimes, is serving sentence next to you. No? You see, it took a decade and a half and an 
	army of CBI officials to convict him, and he made quick work of their efforts by getting bail 
	in a matter of months. Now that's what I call a real politician! Then there's Yeddyurappa. 
	He is a bloody genius! Tons of incriminating evidence, and yet the honorable courts keep 
	quashing cases against him. Clean as a whistle he is!! 
	</p>

	<p>
	Do you see a pattern, or should I spell it out for you? I guess I do have to spell it out for you. 
	You see, you are not a politician, and people have sensed it. 
	The real politicians have sensed it too; and they do not want an impostor in their ranks. 
	No politician would ever resign from the CM's chair on principle. In fact, they wouldn't do 
	anything at all on principle. I am not quite sure what you are, perhaps a revolutionary. 
	Its too early to say. And I am an engineer too, but I remember my history books. 
	If history has taught us anything, it is that revolutionaries rot in jails, 
	and face firing squads, while politicians rule. Remember Bhagat Singh, Gandhi 
	and Nehru? Only one of them was a politician, and only one of them ruled India. 
	</p>
	<p>
	So then, if you want to rule and "change the system from inside",
	learn how to be a politician. Or perish. You have been warned.
	</p>
