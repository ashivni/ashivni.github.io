	<h2> Elections 2014: An efficiency analysis</h2>
	<p>
	The much watched 2014 Indian general election is over. Whether we like the results or not, it was truly a landmark
	event in the history of India. The high voter turnout was a testament to the virility of the Indian 
	democracy, and the verdict in favor of the growth was a witness to a more mature and demanding voter.
	As unifying as the verdict might be (it is, after all, the 1st majority government since 1984), the 
	dynamics of this election were highly divisive. To this affect, I can offer no greater evidence 
	than the blood on my facebook wall. Indeed, the heated debates between the Modi-fieds and 
	the AAP followers have left quite a trail of blood, betrayal and soured friendships on facebook,
	and perhaps (not?) in real life as well. As interesting as that tale might be, thats not 
	what this post is about. This post is about numbers and efficiency of the elections.

	<h3>$ 5 Billion or  &#8377; 30,000 Crore</h3>

	To set the record straight, the Indian general election was WAY more expensive than its American counterpart. 
	Sure, the American election cost 7 billion USD while the Indian election cost 5 billion, and 7 is greater than 5, 
	but what kind of bonehead comparison is that? The GDP of USA is 
	about 16 trillion USD, while that of India is slightly shy of 2 trillion USD. I think a fair comparison would 
	be the cost as a fraction of GDP per-capita. That is comparing the fraction of the national produce that was 
	spend per-person in the elections. Pluggin in the numbers we get that the Indian general election
	cost about 1.6 times more per-capita. We haven't yet taken into account the purchasing power parity (PPP) 
	difference, however, that is a box-of-worms for another day. Suffice it to say that accounting for the PPP 
	will only show that the Indian politicians out-spend their American counterparts by even greater margins.
